# Collabrox

This folder contains the front-end code for the Collabrox project. The front-end is built primarily with TypeScript and styled with CSS.

## Structure
The structure of this folder is designed to facilitate the development of scalable and maintainable front-end applications. Below are some common directories you might find:

- **src/**: Contains the source code for the application.
- **public/**: Contains static assets such as images and icons.

## Getting Started
To run the front-end locally, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the `collabrox` folder:
   ```bash
   cd collabrox
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The development server should now be running, and you can access the application in your browser.
